I can't think of another New York band that plays this kind of music. The band has been together for over three years but they only play out around twice a year. I'm trying to get them to become more visible because I really believe in their music. I hope you can find a slot for them at the Underground. If you have any questions or comments please call me...Thanks, Richard Fantina.</p>
