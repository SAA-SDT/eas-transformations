         <p>John Gillespie Magee, Sr. was born in Pittsburgh, PA on October 10, 1884 to a notable Pittsburgh family, the son of Frederick M. and Hannah Gillespie Magee. He attended Shady Side Academy, the Hotchkiss School, graduating in 1902, and then Yale University, graduating in 1906. At Yale, Magee was a member of the Freshman Religious Committee (1902), Sophomore Class deacon (1903), and Vice President of Dwight Hall, the center for religious activity at Yale during his final year. He was a co-founder, with William Whiting Borden, of the Yale Hope Mission in 1907. From 1908 to 1910 Magee served as General Secretary of Dwight Hall. He spent the summer of 1909 as a missionary among the Winnebago Indians in Nebraska under the sponsorship of the Dutch Reformed Church. After receiving his B.D. from the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1911, he spent the fall of 1911 visiting colleges on behalf of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions.</p>
         <p>Magee was ordained as a minister of the Episcopal Church and appointed to be a missionary in China in 1912, stationed in Nanking [Nanjing]. While in China he met his wife, Faith Emmeline Backhouse, an English missionary serving under the Church Missionary Society. They were married in July 1921 and subsequently raised four sons: John, David, Christopher, and Hugh. When Japanese soldiers invaded Nanking in December 1937, Magee remained in Nanking as a member of the International Safety Zone Committee, which arranged with the Japanese for a section of the city not to be destroyed. As the Japanese soldiers perpetrated atrocities against the people of Nanking, John G. Magee worked tirelessly to save and protect the people he could. During this time he risked his own life to film and document the war crimes carried out by the Japanese soldiers. In 1938, he was able to smuggle these films out of China providing evidence of the Nanking Massacre. Upon his return to the United States in 1940, John G. Magee became the Curate of St. John's Church in Washington, DC, leaving in 1945 to become the chaplain to Episcopal students at Yale University from 1946 to 1953. Magee was serving as Assistant Rector of Calvary Episcopal Church in Pittsburgh, PA when he died following a heart attack in September, 1953.</p>

         <p>John Gillespie Magee, Jr., eldest son of John and Faith Magee, was born in China in 1922. Following his early education at the American School, Nanking (1929–1931) he went to Britain in 1931 where he continued his education first at St Clare preparatory school near Walmer, Kent (1931–1935) and then at Rugby School (1935-1939). In 1938 he won the Rugby School's Rupert Brooke Poetry Prize. Following a visit to the United States in 1939, Magee was unable to return to England due to war time conditions so he completed his education at Avon Old Farms School in Avon, Connecticut. He earned a scholarship to Yale University in July 1940 but did not enroll, choosing instead to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force in October of that year. He died on December 11, 1941 at age 19 in a mid-air collision while on active service in England. Magee was the author of many poems but is best known for "High Flight", which was written in 1941 shortly before his death. This poem is a favorite among aviators and one of the most celebrated poems resulting from World War II.</p>

                        <p>This medal was accepted on behalf of the Magee family by Christopher Magee (grandson of John G. Magee) in Nanjing in 2017. The main pattern on the medal is the Zijin Grass, or Violet Orychopragmus, a familiar plant for Nanjing residents. In the center of the medal is a seal with the character yi, meaning justice and symbolizing the foreigners' brave defense of justice and priceless love for Nanjing refugees.</p>
