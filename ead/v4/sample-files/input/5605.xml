               <p>This series consists of demos and other recordings of musical acts active in the early- to mid-1980s. Most were sent to Jim Fouratt by artists seeking to perform at clubs like Hurrah!, Danceteria, The Underground, Pepermint Lounge, and others. The recordings document the transition of the New York scene from Punk to Post-Punk and New Wave, and represent a diverse range of hundreds of artists including notable acts such as Miracle Legion, They Might Be Giants, Human Sexual Response, Bow Wow Wow, Living Colour, Pylon, The Replacements, R.E.M., Ornette Coleman, Daniel Johnston, New Order, Ministry, Richard Lloyd, Suzanne Vega, Yo La Tengo, The Misfits, Hüsker Dü, Bad Brains, The B-52's, Two Nice Girls, and many others.</p>

                  <p>A letter from Richard Fantina is included. It reads, in part: "Jim, I hope you enjoy this tape of 2 songs by Idle Sponsor. I can't think of another New York band that plays this kind of music. The band has been together for over three years but they only play out around twice a year. I'm trying to get them to become more visible because I really believe in their music. I hope you can find a slot for them at the Underground. If you have any questions or comments please call me...Thanks, Richard Fantina.</p>
